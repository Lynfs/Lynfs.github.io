# wake up, Neo!

Let's say i'm a curious guy who likes to understand how the world around me works, whether through calculations or reflections.  
My journey started when, as a child, i had my Habbo Hotel account hacked (yah, pretty sad). After a lot of pain and suffering, i decided that i would only rest when i found out how the f*ck that guy had managed to access my account without my creds (Spoiler: it was stealing my cookies and session respectively).
After finding out how it worked, i decided to go after more knowledge, as i saw that there was a world that i had not explored.  
Immersed in the Matrix philosophy, i began to see the world with new eyes, eyes that until then i only used to play with, and from that day on i dedicated my free time to understand the processes behind a machine that, until then, i only knew by movies, and i thought:  
-"I think i discovered a new reality. Don't wake me up yet, cuz i want to know more about this world."  
Today i know how i got hacked, and i spend my life hacking out of pure passion. I think i can say that the matrix went from ocean to playground, and the more i follow the white rabbit, the more delighted i get with the wonders of science and technology!  
Knock knock ...
