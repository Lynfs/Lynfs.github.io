Hi, i'm lynfs, i'm from Brazil, and this is a simple page with some challenges that i've solved on CTF's that i've played, articles about infosec and any other madness that comes in mind at 3am.

I'm a student of information systems at UFRPE, analysis and systems development tech. ctf player at Deadlock team, and i like to make research about Web application security and pizza. Megadeth > metalica, 21 yo and lets pwn the world.
