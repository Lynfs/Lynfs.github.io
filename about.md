Hi, i'm Eliabe (or lynfs if you prefer), i'm from Brazil, and this is a simple page with some challenges that i've solved on CTF's that i've played, articles about information security, data science and any other science madness that comes in mind at 3am.  

I'm a student at Computer Science degree, Information Security Analyst (Red Team at the moment), Analysis and systems development tech and CTF player at [Deadlock team](https://deadlock.team/). I like to study some physics & math stuff, make research about Web application security and taste pizza flavors. Megadeth > metalica, 90's man, Tolkienist and leroooy jeeenkins! 

for more, you can ask me on [Telegram](t.me/lynfs)
