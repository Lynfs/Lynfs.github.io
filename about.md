Hi, i'm Eliabe (or lynfs if you prefer), i'm from Brazil, and this is a simple page with some challenges that i've solved on CTF's that i've played, articles about infosec and any other madness that comes in mind at 3am.
I'm a student of information systems at UFRPE, analysis and systems development tech. ctf player at [Deadlock team](https://deadlock.team/), and i like to make research about Web application security and pizza flavors. Megadeth > metalica, 90's man and leroooy jeeenkins!.
