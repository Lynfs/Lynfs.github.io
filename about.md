Hi, i'm Eliabe (or lynfs if you prefer), i'm from Brazil, and this is a simple page with some challenges that i've solved on CTF's that i've played, articles about infosec, data science and any other science madness that comes in mind at 3am.  
I'm a student at Computer Science degree, Information Security Analyst (Red Team at the moment), Analysis and systems development tech. CTF player at [Deadlock team](https://deadlock.team/), and i like to make research about Web application security and pizza flavors. Megadeth > metalica, 90's man, Tolkienist and leroooy jeeenkins!
